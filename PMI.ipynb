       "'Submission Statement: I did an IamA both on this subreddit and /r/IAmA two years ago upon my release from prison, but short version is I\\'m a longtime journalist and activist with an interest in state corruption, surveillance, propaganda, etc. After my release I covered Dallas politics for D Magazine, the local monthly, and eventually the Amber Guyger case, during which I attracted a great deal of animosity from not only local police but also the Dallas Morning News and other outlets, since I was most interested in how badly they screwed up the story by taking contradictory cop statements as facts that could be reported as such. In November D got a bomb threat, which police told them to keep quiet (this is never how threats to news outlets are handled, which is why CNN was evacuated under similar circumstances just a week or so later, and covered it themselves for next few hours). I made it public, angering my editor, who thought the cops were trustworthy. Later, when my city councilman asked assistant police chief about all this, the latter sent him an email claiming the suspect had been brought in and would be charged (and even cited the two counts). This was different than what my editor had been told, so after I published the email, he wrote an article about the whole thing, and then got a call from the Dallas police, which he recorded. For some reason, D took down the article the next day without explanation (possibly because it was kind of a bitchy article that criticizes me, somewhat inappropriately - the editor is a notorious punk, but not a bad guy in his own way).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n Yesterday, former Wikileaks associate Emma Best released the recording via her Distributed Denial of Secrets outfit, along with the email I  sent yesterday morning to assistant police chief Lonzo Anderson and mayor\\'s top aide (an even bigger punk) giving them the chance to comment before my upcoming book is finalized. The local press has refused to mention any of this, even though the recording is, after all, a cop pressuring an editor to keep a story quiet and ensure that the only named victim (me) is not given information about all this, and claiming that the assistant police chief\\'s statement to a city councilman was \"not true\". In conclusion, Dallas is a terrible city.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAdditional background, from a post I made this afternoon:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhen Dallas police union head Mike Mata told Dallas Morning News that Botham Jean killer Amber Guyger was receiving \"death threats\", they reported this as fact (\"Guyger has received threats online and through her phone.\" - Dana Branham, Sept 10 2018). But when the sole witness to the shooting reported that she had received threats, the Dallas Morning News was less interested in taking her word for it (\"It is unclear whether Babbs reported the threats to authorities, but Dallas police could find no record Monday of such a report.\" - Jennifer Emily, Feb 19, 2019) This reporter, Jennifer Emily, has previously cited one of the two contradictory accounts from Guyger about why she shot a man in his own apartment as \"what happened\".\\n\\nIf you\\'re wondering why the Dallas Morning News is ignoring yesteray\\'s release of the recording of a Dallas cop admitting to lies and cover-ups over November\\'s bomb threats, remember the astonishing degree to which this paper has staked its own credibility on that of the Dallas Police.'"
